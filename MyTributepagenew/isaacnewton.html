  <h2>Brief timeline of Sir Isaac Newton</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1942</strong>-Born in Woolsthrpe England.</li>
    <li><strong>1654-1659</strong>-Newton was educated at The King's School, Grantham which taught Latin and Greek but no mathematics .</li>
    <li><strong>1659</strong>-He was removed from school and taken to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, where his mother, widowed for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him. Newton hated farming</li>
    <li><strong>1661</strong>-He was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, on the recommendation of his uncle Rev William Ayscough.</li>
    <li><strong>1665</strong>- He discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus and obtained B.A degree.</li>
    <li><strong>1666</strong>-Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles.This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years.</li>
    <li><strong>1667</strong>-Returned to Cambridge and in October was elected as a fellow of Trinity. </li>
    <li><strong>1669</strong>-Newton was appointed professor of mathematics at Trinity College.</li>
    <li><strong>1670-1672</strong>-He lectured on Optics</li>
    <li><strong>1687</strong>-His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published.</li>
    <li><strong>1691</strong>-He was elected to Parliarment.</li>
    <li><strong>1693</strong>-Survived a nervous breakdown</li>
    <li><strong>1696</strong>-He was appointed warden of the mint and master of the mint three years later.</li>
    <li><strong>1703</strong>-He was elected president of the Royal Society in 1703 and was knighted in 1705.</li>
